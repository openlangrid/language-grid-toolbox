<p>The Service Settings function enables you to configure services on Toolbox including translation services. Toolbox provides two types for Service Settings. One is for configuring personal settings, which allow users to preserve their own settings. Another is for configuring settings shared by all users. One of the two settings are enabled depending on functions on Toolbox. On Service Settings (Shared) page, you can configure settings shared by all users.</p>

<p>On this page, you will find a brief description of the following features. The usage is common in the personal and shared settings.</p>
