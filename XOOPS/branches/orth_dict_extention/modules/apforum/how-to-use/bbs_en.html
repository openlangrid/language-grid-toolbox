Multilingual BBS is a BBS that enables users to post messages in different languages and translate them into other languages by using machine translation services and dictionary services. <p>
<p>
On this page, you will find a brief manual of how to use the Multilingual BBS function, including </p>
<ol>
<li>1. How to display BBS contents in different languages</li>
<li>2. How to preview translation results of contents</li>
<li>3. How to modify translation results</li>
<li>4. How to mark up source text that does not need to translate</li>
<li>5. How to configure notification of new post</li>
<li>6. How to set translation services</li>
<li>7. How to define message tags</li>

</ol>
<dl><dt>1. How to display BBS contents in different languages</dt>
<dd>You can set the display language of the multilingual BBS contents by selecting the drop-down box of languages on the top of each page in BBS.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>2. How to preview translation results of contents</dt>
<dd>When creating or pre-editing category information, forum information, topic information or messages, you can preview translation results and back-translation results in all available target languages by clicking the <span class="key_point">"Translate"</span> button on the right side of the entered contents. </dd>

<dd>You can modify the translation results to improve the translation quality if the back-translation results are satisfying. During the modification, you can check <span class="key_point">Commit</span> in a certain target language area if you do not want to change the translation result in that language when you retry translation of the original contents. The translation results and back-translation results can be shown/hidden by clicking "+"/"-" in the related areas.</dd>
</dl>



<dl><dt>3. How to post-edit translation results</dt>
<dd>Machine translation results of category information, forum information, topic information, and messages can be modified to improve the quality. You can click the <span class="key_point">"Post-edit"</span> button on the right of each translation result to post-edit it. </dd>

<dd>In each category page, when the category name/description is a translation result in the displayed language, a <span class="key_point">"Post-edit"</span> button will appear on the right that category description. You can click the <span class="key_point">"Post-edit"</span> button to post-edit the translation results to improve the machine translation quality. The same function is provided in each forum page, topic page.</dd>


<dl><dt>4. How to mark up source text that does not need to translate</dt>
<dd>You can use <span class="key_point">[tag][/tag]</span> to mark up source text that does not need to translate. For example, if you do not want to translate the word "Barack Hussein Obama II" in the sentence "Barack Hussein Obama II is the 44th and current President of the United States", you can mark the sentence as "[tag]Barack Hussein Obama II[/tag] is the 44th and current President of the United States".</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>5. How to configure notification of new post</dt>
<dd>
Open a popup window by clicking <span class="key_point">"Preferences"</span> on the top page. On this popup window, you can select "None", "For each post" or "Once a day" for notification of new posts on BBS. Notifications will be sent to the e-mail address set to your account.
